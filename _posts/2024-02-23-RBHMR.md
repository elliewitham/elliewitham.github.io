title: Recovering Black History in the Monadnock Region - Keene 
---

**Recovering Black History in the Monadnock Region** is a citizen-archivist project. The lead archivist, Jenna Carroll, the Director of Education at the Historical Society of Cheshire County, volunteers, and a Northeastern University-based research team are tracing the history of Black individuals in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire from the 1730s to the 1930s. 

<a href="https://keeneblackhistory.com/" target="_blank">The site I have created</a> is a digital collection of material that has been found relating to the Black history of Keene, a city in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. It has been created as part of my work in Northeastern University's Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate program, in collaboration with those researching Keene. 

The collection hopes to make visible Black experiences in 19th century Keene. The repository will bring together all material located and created by archivists, volunteers, scholars, and student researchers.
