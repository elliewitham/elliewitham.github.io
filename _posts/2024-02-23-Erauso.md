title: Scalar project on The Life, Reception, and Utilization of Antonio de Erauso, the Lieutenant Nun
---
<p> How does a historical figure become a legend? What does it mean for a historical figure to be a spectacle?As part of the graduate level history course, Readings and Methods in Digital History, I took in the fall of 2023, I created a digital storytelling exhibit using Scalar on Antonio de Erauso, commonly known as the subject of the 16th century memoir, La Monja Alférez, or The Lieutenant Nun. I created the exhibit to examine him as a significant yet controversial figure in LGBT history and his colonial legacy. </p>

<p>Antonio de Erauso grew up in a convent as Catalina de Erauso in San Sebastian, Spain, until escaping before taking vows to become a nun. In order to evade being caught, Erauso donned a disguise as a man. He would then go on to travel to the Americas, becoming an esteemed figure due in large part to his military exploits. Erauso lived life as a man in the Americas, until being caught for his crimes led him to confessing his identity as Catalina to a bishop. This story gained Erauso fame, and led him to write, or dictate, an autobiography. Erauso's story is an intersection of gender transgressiveness and colonialism. </p>

<p> In order to sufficiently explore the historiography of the narrative’s reception and manipulations, I used Scalar to create digital paths that would allow for users to explore thematic connections that occur in different periods, while also having the choice to learn about the story as it has evolved over time. </p>

<p>The "messiness" of Erauso’s identity is critical to his celebrity, and I felt I needed to investigate and call attention to it. The life and legacy of Erauso is to be commended but also confronted—he benefited from masculinity and colonialism, but he can still be understood as a force and interruption of societal norms. </p> 

<p> Note: I am using the he/him/his series of pronouns to refer to Erauso. Because Erauso lived the rest of his life in Mexico as a man, going by Antonio de Erauso, I have chosen to refer to him by the he/him/his series of pronouns.  </p>
