I'm a Master's student at Northeastern University pursuing a degree in Public History and the Digital Humanities certificate. I graduated from Northeastern University in May of 2023 with my Bachelor's in History. I'm interested in issues of race and gender in 18th and 19th century America, as well as methods of digital public history, reparative metadata, and queer archival theory.
